ðŸ‘‹ **Hello there!** I'm Mosaab, a passionate and self-driven computer science student navigating the challenges at [1337 Coding School](https://www.1337.ma/).

In this space, my goal is to offer **practical tutorials and guides** centered around AI/ML. I firmly believe in the power of hands-on experience, starting with implementation and then delving into comprehensive explanations. My commitment extends to keeping abreast of the latest research, and I take pleasure in sharing my knowledge and insights through the content you'll find on this blog.

Join me on this journey of exploration and learningâ€”we're bound to have some fun and pick up valuable insights along the way!
